/**
 * S - Single Responsibility Principle
 * A Class should have only one reason to change.
 * A class should have only one responsibility not more than one.
 * In Invoice class has three responsibilities
 * 1. Calculate the total price
 * If I introduce GST then I have to change the calculateTotal logic
 * 2. Print the Invoice
 * If I change the logic to print Invoice
 * 3. Save Data to the DB
 * If I want to save to file, then I need to change the logic to save Invoice.
 * Here there are 3 reasons to change Invoice the class,
 * so it is not following Single Responsibility Principle.
 *
 * Advantage is Easy to maintain code.

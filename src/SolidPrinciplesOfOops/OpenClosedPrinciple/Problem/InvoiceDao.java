 * O - Open/Closed Principle
 * Open for Extension but Closed for Modification.
 * New Requirement came to add feature to save data to file. So introduced a method to save data to file which is tested and is on live application
 * So here we have modified the InvoiceDao class instead of extending the same Class
 * to New class for implementing the feature.
 * InvoiceDao class is not following Open/Closed Principle.
